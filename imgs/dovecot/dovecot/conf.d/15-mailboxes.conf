  # These mailboxes are widely used and could perhaps be created automatically:
  mailbox Archive {
    auto = subscribe

  }
  mailbox Drafts {
    auto = subscribe
    special_use = \Drafts
  }
  mailbox Junk {

    autoexpunge = 30d
  }
  mailbox Spam {
    auto = subscribe
    special_use = \Junk
    autoexpunge = 30d
  }
  mailbox Trash {
    special_use = \Trash
    autoexpunge = 30d
  }

  # For \Sent mailboxes there are two widely used names. We'll mark both of
  # them as \Sent. User typically deletes one of them if duplicates are created.
  mailbox Sent {
    auto = subscribe
    special_use = \Sent
  }
  mailbox "Sent Messages" {
    special_use = \Sent
  }

  mailbox virtual/All {
    auto = subscribe
    special_use = \All
  }

  mailbox virtual/Flagged {
    auto = subscribe
    special_use = \Flagged
  }
}
